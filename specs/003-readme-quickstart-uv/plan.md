# Implementation Plan: Add UV and FastMCP Documentation

**Branch**: `003-readme-quickstart-uv` | **Date**: 2025-10-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Summary
This plan outlines the process for updating the project's core documentation (`README.md` and `docs/quickstart.rst`) to include setup instructions for using the `uv` package manager and configuring `gemini-cli` with the `fastmcp` command. This addresses a gap in the current user onboarding experience.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12
**Primary Dependencies**: N/A (Documentation change)
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS/Windows (where Python is supported)
**Project Type**: Single project
**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project (Default)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: All checks pass. This is a documentation-only change with no impact on architecture, testing, or other core principles.*

**Simplicity**: PASS
**Architecture**: PASS
**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: PASS
**Observability**: PASS
**Versioning**: PASS

```

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
**Status**: Complete. No research was necessary as the requirements were clear and self-contained.
**Output**: `research.md`

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
**Status**: Complete. No data modeling or API contracts were necessary for this documentation update.
**Output**: `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning
**Status**: Complete. The tasks have been generated based on the specification.
**Task Generation Strategy**: Tasks were created directly from the functional requirements to update the two specified documentation files.
**Output**: `tasks.md`
