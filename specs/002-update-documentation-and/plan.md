# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → data-model.md, quickstart.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Update project documentation (README, docs) to reflect the current FastMCP architecture, add optional dependencies to `pyproject.toml`, and create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate package publication to PyPI.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python >=3.8
**Primary Dependencies**: fastmcp, mcts, mcts-solver
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Linux / Platform-independent
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: N/A

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- This feature focuses on documentation and CI/CD, adhering to simplicity.

**Architecture**:
- Not applicable, as this is not a functional library feature.

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- TDD will be applied where applicable.
- The CI/CD workflow will be tested by deploying to TestPyPI first.
- The optional dependency installation will be tested in a clean environment.

**Observability**:
- N/A for this feature.

**Versioning**:
- The release workflow will be based on Git tags (e.g., v0.1.0), adhering to versioning principles.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - This involves documenting the files and configurations to be changed.

2. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories → `quickstart.md`:
   - This will serve as a draft for the final user-facing documentation.

3. **API Contracts and Tests**:
   - Not applicable for this feature, as no APIs are being developed. This step is skipped.

**Output**: data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- The `/tasks` command will generate a detailed task list in `tasks.md`.
- Each task will be derived directly from one of the Functional Requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) defined in `spec.md`.
- Tasks will be concrete actions, such as using the `replace` tool to update a documentation file, using `write_file` to create the GitHub Actions workflow, or using `run_shell_command` to test the installation.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Tasks will be ordered logically to ensure dependencies are met.
  1.  Configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `MANIFEST.in`) will be updated first.
  2.  Documentation files (`README.md`, `docs/*.rst`) will be updated next.
  3.  The GitHub Actions workflow (`release.yml`) will be created.
  4.  Verification steps (e.g., testing the `pip install .[shogi]` command) will be placed after the relevant implementation tasks.
- Tasks that can be performed independently (e.g., updating `README.md` and `docs/quickstart.rst`) will be marked for parallel execution.

**Estimated Output**: Approximately 10-15 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
