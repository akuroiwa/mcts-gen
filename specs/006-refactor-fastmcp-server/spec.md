# Feature Specification: Refactor fastmcp_server to use @mcp.prompt

**Feature Branch**: `006-refactor-fastmcp-server`  
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Refactor fastmcp_server to use @mcp.prompt, removing the AGENTS.md dependency."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a package maintainer, I want to embed the agent's instructions directly into the Python code using `@mcp.prompt` so that end-users do not need to manage a separate `AGENTS.md` context file, simplifying distribution and usage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the `mcts-gen` package is installed, **When** the `fastmcp_server` is run, **Then** it MUST offer the `mcts_autonomous_search` prompt without requiring an `AGENTS.md` file.
2. **Given** the project source, **When** the package is built, **Then** the `AGENTS.md` file MUST NOT be included in the final distribution.
3. **Given** the documentation, **When** a user reads `README.md` or `docs/quickstart.rst`, **Then** they MUST be informed that prompts are built-in and instructed on how to provide *additional* context if needed.
4. **Given** the project configuration, **When** `pyproject.toml` and `docs/conf.py` are inspected, **Then** the version MUST be `0.0.2`.

### Edge Cases
- **What happens if a user provides their own `AGENTS.md` through a separate configuration?** The server should prioritize its built-in prompts. The documentation should clarify this behavior, stating that user-provided context is for *additional* instructions, not for overriding the core prompts.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The `fastmcp_server.py` MUST be refactored to define the MCTS agent's core workflow and instructions using the `@mcp.prompt` decorator.
- **FR-002**: The `src/mcts_gen/AGENTS.md` file MUST be deleted from the source tree.
- **FR-003**: The `pyproject.toml` file MUST be modified to remove the `package-data` entry for `AGENTS.md`.
- **FR-004**: The `version` in `pyproject.toml` MUST be updated to `0.0.2`.
- **FR-005**: The `version` in `docs/conf.py` MUST be updated to `0.0.2`.
- **FR-006**: `README.md` MUST be updated to explain that core prompts are now built-in and to guide users on how to supply additional, custom context.
- **FR-007**: `docs/quickstart.rst` MUST be updated with the same information as `README.md` regarding the new prompt mechanism.
